  <h2>Roxana Jorgensen</h2>
    <p>I am doing the Applied Technology Bachelor Degree. 
    I wanted to start a career that could have the possibility to work from home. 
      I love that I can take all my classes online. 
      It makes things a lot easier. </p>
    <p>I love the scripture Alma 32:21 where it says that "if ye have faith ye hope for thing which are not seen, which are true."
       I love scriptures about faith. </p>
